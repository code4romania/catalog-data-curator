### Notes

### Tasks
- enhance unit test coverage
- add integration tests - spring boot allows integration testing,
 so we can start parse server and actually feed it data to process 
 and validate results. This will also help making sure we don't break
 other code that we are not aware of
    - keep test data with the test code
